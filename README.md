# rabbitmq-system
This is a project to demonstrate different features of RabbitMQ using amqp library for Javascript

The numeral in the name of the file regards to the tutorial number. In order to test the producer and consumer for a tutorial, let's say 1, run the file 1receive.js first in a console and then run 1send.js in another console.

Before running these files, please make sure that you have RabbitMQ installed and server running on localhost default port.

If you haven't installed RabbitMQ, find the tutorial here for all systems (options available at the website): https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-homebrew.html
